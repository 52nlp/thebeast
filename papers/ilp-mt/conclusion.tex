Discuss:
\begin{itemize}
\item Generating the ILP program can take as long as solving.
\item Tighter integration of program generation and the ILP solver.
\item How to handle larger language models.  Left-to-right decoders
  can easily accommodate this, ILP not so.
\end{itemize}

Future work:
\begin{itemize}
\item Other MT models as ILP, will these be faster/slower etc?
\item Injection of linguistic knowledge through constraints.
\end{itemize}
