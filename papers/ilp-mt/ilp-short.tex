Given a trained IBM model 4 and a French sentence $\target$ we need
to find the English sentence $\source$ and alignment $\align$ with
maximal $p\left(\align,\source|f\right)\backsimeq p\left(\source\right)\cdot p\left(\align,\target|\source\right)$.
\citet{germann01fast} presented an Integer Linear Programming~(ILP) formulation of this problem. In this section we will give a very high-level description of this formulation.%
\footnote{Note that our actual formulation differs slightly from the
original work because we use a first order modelling
language that imposed certain restrictions on the type of constraints
allowed.%
} For brevity we refer the reader to the original work for more details. 

In the formulation of \citet{germann01fast} an English translation is
represented as the journey of a travelling salesman that visits one
English token (hotel) per French token (city). Here the English token
serves as the translation of the French one. A set
of binary variables denote whether or not certain English token pairs are
directly connected in this journey. Along with constraints which
guarantee that for each French token exactly one English
token is visited, the program also contains an exponential number of
constraints that forbid the possible cycles the variables can
represent. It is this set of constraints that renders MT decoding with ILP difficult.
