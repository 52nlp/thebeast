We presented a Markov Logic Network that performs joint multi-lingual Semantic 
Role Labelling. This network achieves the third best semantic F-scores in the 
closed track among the SRLOnly systems of the CoNLL-09 Shared Task, and sixth 
best semantic scores among SRLOnly and Joint systems for the closed task.
% SR closed or open???

We observed that the inclusion of features which take into account 
information about the siblings of the argument were benefitial for 
SRL performance on the Japanese dataset. We also noticed that our poor performance with Czech 
are caused by our frame ID heuristic. Further work 
has to be done in order to overcome this problem.
