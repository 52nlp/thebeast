We presented a Markov Logic Network that performs joint multi-lingual Semantic 
Role Labelling. This network achieves the third best semantic F-scores in the 
closed track among the SRLOnly systems of the CoNLL-09 Shared Task, and sixth 
best semantic among SRLOnly and Joint systems for the closed task.

We noticed that the inclusion of features which take into account the 
information from the siblings of the SRL argument were beneficial for the 
Japanese language. We also identified that our poor performance with Czech 
language has its origin in the predicate identification/sense disambiguation 
which our model for the language did not took into consideration. Further work 
has to be done to look to extend such model.
