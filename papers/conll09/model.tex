In order to model the SRL task in the ML framework, we propose four hidden 
predicates, consider the example of the previous section:
\begin{description}
    \item [\emph{argument/1}] indicates the phrase for which its head is a 
        specific position is an SRL argument. For the example,     
        \emph{argument(2)} signals that the phrase for which the word in 
        position $2$ is the head is an argument (i.e., \emph{Ms. Haag}).
    \item [\emph{hasRole/2}] relates a SRL predicate to a SRL argument. For the 
        example, \emph{hasRole(3,2)} relates the
        predicate in position $3$ (i.e., \emph{play}) to the phrase which head 
        is in position $2$ (i.e., \emph{Ms. Haag}).
    \item [\emph{role/3}] besides to relating predicate and argument, it also
        identifies a role for the pair. For the example,
        \emph{role(3,2,ARG0)} signals the role for the predicate-argument role 
        presented above.
    \item [\emph{sense/2}] signals the sense identifier that a predicate in a
        specific position has. For the example, \emph{sense(3,02)}
        signals that the predicate in position $3$ has the sense \emph{02}.
\end{description}

We also define three sets of observable predicates. The first set are a direct 
map of the the information provided for each token in the closed Track of the 
Shared Task corpora:  \emph{word} for the orthography, \emph{plemma/2} for the 
lemma, \emph{ppos/2} for the POS tag, \emph{feature/3} for each feature-value 
pair, \emph{dependency/3} for the head dependency and relation, and 
\emph{predicate/1} if the token is a predicate. We will refer to these 
predicates as the \emph{token} predicates.

The second set extends the information provided by the columns of the corpus: 
\emph{cpos/2} is a coarse pos task, \emph{possibleArg/1} is true if based 
on heuristics on the POS tag the token is a potential SRL argument and 
\emph{voice/2} signals the voice for verbal tokens based on heuristics of the 
syntactic information or the features of the column FEAT of the corpora. We 
were refer to these predicates as the \emph{extended} predicates.

Finally the third set represent syntactic information. These predicates are 
based on the features proposed by \citet{xue04calibrating}. We have two types of 
predicates for this set: \emph{paths} and \emph{frames}.  Paths capture the 
dependency path between two tokens, and frame the subcategorisation frame for a 
token and its head. For the path predicates we have a directed and undirected 
version. For both path and frame we have labelled and unlabelled versions.  
Finally, we have a frame predicate with the distance from the predicate to its 
head.  We were refer to the paths predicates as the \emph{path} predicates, 
while we will consider the \emph{frame} predicates part of the \emph{token} 
predicates.


We use the previous ML predicates to define the formulae which is at the core of 
the ML for SRL there is a set of formulae.  We distinguish between two types of 
formula: local and global.
