\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present a Markov Logic Network for Semantic Role
Labelling that jointly performs predicate identification, frame
disambiguation, argument identification and argument classification
for all predicates in a sentence. Empirically we find that our
approach is competitive: our best model would appear on par
with the best entry in the CoNLL 2008 shared task open track, and at
the 4th place of the closed track---right behind the systems that use
significantly better parsers to generate their input features.
%IV-
%In contrast, our model uses the vanilla MALT
%parses provided by the shared task organizers. 
Moreover, we observe
that by fully capturing the complete SRL pipeline in a single
probabilistic model we can achieve significant improvements over more isolated systems, in particular for out-of-domain
data. Finally, we show that despite the joint approach, our
system is still efficient.

% Reviewer 1

% 1. error analysis can be very difficul, discussed.
%    IV. Mention this ??
% 2. The natural question, why the authors didn't switch parsers.
%    IV. Dogde this ball, for now.
% 3. Statistical signficant.
%    IV. Maybe do this
% 4. Number of assigments
%    IV. ?? No idea what's this.
% 5. Pipe-line -> other systems.
%    IV. Make clear this is seb's implementation (include beast links and models)
% 6. Equation (1), w is the same as w-sub-phii next line? 
%    I think it should be the same, check with Seb
% 7. Phi Subscript for (phi,w), is it right?
%    I think it is right
% 8. primes x' and take'.
%    Erase the simple quotes (Done)
% 9. Figure 2, functor w?
%    Figure says rectangles are formulae and functors. We need to clarify this.
%    (done)
% 10. Figure 2, subscript a, rather than a simple index.
%    Change the subscripts.
% 11. Explanation of '+'
%     Imply that weights have indeces, rather than what means. (done)
% 12. End of Section 1.  Second reference to section 3 looks like it should be to
%     section 4.

% Reviewer 2
%---
% 1. For comparison purposes, are better parses available?
%    IV. Dodge the ball.
% 2. If so, would using them result in significantly different results?
%    IV. Maybe hint this happens, otherwise dodge the ball.
% 3. high-level description of previously published inference methods -
%    I'd suggest either including some lines of pseudocode or just including the pointers to the previous work - right now.
% 4. which contains not just an interpreter but also a number of inference algorithms ?)

% 1. little more detail in the particulars of the MLN training process,i
% 2. how the data was prepared in order for used as input.
