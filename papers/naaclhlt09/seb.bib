	 consolidating large amounts of biological knowledge in computer-accessible
	 form. This strategy is particularly attractive for extracting data
	 relevant to genes of the human genome from the 11 million abstracts in
	 Medline. However, extraction efforts have been frustrated by the
	 lack of conventions for describing human genes and proteins. We have
	 developed and evaluated a variety of learned information extraction
	 systems for identifying human protein names in Medline abstracts
	 and subsequently extracting information on interactions between the
	 proteins. We demonstrate that machine learning approaches using support
	 vector machines and hidden Markov models are able to identify human
	 proteins with higher accuracy than several previous approaches. We also
	 demonstrate that various rule induction methods are able to identify
	 protein interactions more accurately than manually-developed rules.},

@misc{culotta05practical,
	Abstract = { {\sl Markov logic} is a highly
	 expressive language recently introduced to specify the connectivity of a
	 Markov network using first-order logic. While Markov logic is capable
	 of constructing arbitrary first-order formulae over the data, the
	 complexity of these formulae is often limited in practice because of the
	 size and connectivity of the resulting network. In this paper, we
	 present approximate inference and training methods that incrementally
	 instantiate portions of the network as needed to enable first-order
	 existential and universal quantifiers in {\sl Markov logic networks}.
	 When applied to the problem of object identification, this approach
	 results in a conditional probabilistic model that can reason about
	 objects, combining the expressivity of recently introduced BLOG models
	 with the predictive power of conditional training. We validate our
	 algorithms on the tasks of citation matching and author disambiguation.},

@inproceedings{koller99Probabilistic,
	Abstract = {Probabilistic models provide a sound and coherent foundation for
	 dealing with the noise and uncertainty encountered in most real-world
	 domains. Bayesian networks are a language for representing complex
	 probabilistic models in a compact and natural way. A Bayesian network can be
	 used to reason about any attribute in the domain, given any set of
	 observations. It can thus be used for a variety tasks, including
	 prediction, explanation, and decision making. The probabilistic semantics
	 also gives a strong foundation for the task of learning models from
	 data. Techniques currently exist for learning both the structure and
	 the parameters, for dealing with missing data and hidden variables,
	 and for discovering causal structure. One of the main limitations
	 of Bayesian networks is that they represent the world in terms of
	 a fixed set of ``attributes''. Like propositional logic, they are
	 incapable of reasoning explicitly about entities, and thus cannot
	 represent models over domains where the set of entities and the relations
	 between them are not fixed in advance. As a consequence, Bayesian
	 networks are limited in their ability to model large and complex
	 domains. Probabilistic relational models are a language for describing
	 probabilistic models based on the significantly more expressive basis of
	 relational logic. They allow the domain to be represented in terms of
	 entities, their properties, and the relations between them. These
	 models represent the uncertainty over the properties of an entity,
	 representing its probabilistic dependence both on other properties of
	 that entity and on properties of related entities. They can even
	 represent uncertainty over the relational structure itself. Some of the
	 techniques for Bayesian network learning can be generalized to this
	 setting, but the learning problem is far from solved. Probabilistic
	 relational models provide a new framework, and new challenges, for
	 the endeavor of learning relational models for real-world domains.},
