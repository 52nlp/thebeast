Markov TheBeast 0.0.1

to run call

$ bin/thebeast

for an interactive mode or

$ bin/thebeast <inputfile>

to execute the specified input pml file.

For starters, have a look at the examples in examples/* (and examples/*/README). I highly recommend using these as
starting point for your own MLNs. 

More details can be found in a half-baked doc/manual.pdf.

Hint: change the bin/thebeast script to increase/decrease java heap size.
