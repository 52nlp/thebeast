Introduction:
-------------

This directory contains a small toy MLN for Semantic Role Labelling. To get going just call

$ thebeast toy.pml

This will train and test on a small toy corpus. Have a look at toy.pml to see what is going on.

While toy.pml helps to get a rough overview, it does reflect the normal Machine Learning workflow:
usually we would train a model and then run tests with the same model on several datasets. However,
with toy.pml we would need to train again everytime we want to test our model on a new test corpus.

Thus this directory also contains three more files: init.pml, train.pml and test.pml.
Calling them in this order will first do some data preprocessing, then training and  finally testing.
This setup allows to do test the same model on different test tests. Moreover, unless the formulae
of the MLN have been changed the init.pml file does not need to be executed when we train
on the same data but change some training parameters.

Expected Behaviour:
-------------------

If things go well calling toy.pml will produce a lot of screen output. If things go really well
the final screen will read something like:
