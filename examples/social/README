Introduction:
-------------

This directory contains a small toy MLN for predicting which movies
a set of persons in a social network may like.

To get going just call

$ thebeast toy.pml

This will train and test on a small toy corpus. Have a look at toy.pml to see what is going on.

While toy.pml helps to get a rough overview, it does reflect the normal Machine Learning workflow:
usually we would train a model and then run tests with the same model on several datasets. However,
with toy.pml we would need to train again everytime we want to test our model on a new test corpus.
To see how to write pml files that allow us to follow a traditional Machine Learning workflow
please check the train.pml/test.pml files in the examples/srl and examples/alignment
directories.

Expected Behaviour:
-------------------

If things go well calling toy.pml will produce a lot of screen output. If things go really well
the final screen will read something like:


Directory Content:
------------------

soical.pml        the root MLN file for the (toy) social network example 
social-types.pml  the type definitions
toy.pml           a script that does training, testing and some more.
train.atoms       training corpus
test.atoms        test corpus
README            this file

Note that some of the pml scripts will create some extra files in this directory.
