For install instructions have a look [Installation here].

http://thebeast.googlecode.com/svn/tags/thebeast-0.0.2/doc/manual.pdf

The distribution includes a [http://thebeast.googlecode.com/svn/tags/thebeast-0.0.2/doc/manual.pdf manual]. However, it is far from complete. We thus recommend to also have a look at the [http://thebeast.googlecode.com/svn/branches/thebeast-0.0.x/doc/manual.pdf updated version].

There are several (well, two for now) [Tutorials tutorials] to get you started. Highly recommended: use the corresponding files as starting point for your own projects.
